Overview

This project analyzes the key drivers of excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia with the goal to develop the general predictive model, risk assessment, insurance products, underwriting, etc. in order to apply for the future pandemic. 

The analysis integrates data from multiple sources i.e: Australian Bureau of Statistic and AIHW.

TASK

Perform data cleaning and data visualization

Intepret the result

SOME KEY DRIVERS

Excess Mortality vs. COVID-19 Deaths by Year: This visualization compares actual deaths and excess mortality across the years 2020 to 2023. It highlights the increase in deaths due to COVID-19 and shows the impact of the pandemic on overall mortality rates.

Age and Gender Distribution of Mortality: The analysis explores mortality rates across age groups and gender, with a focus on middle-aged and elderly populations. It reveals that individuals over the age of 75 are at a significantly higher risk of death due to both COVID-19 and other comorbid conditions.

Excess Mortality Across Regions: A heatmap illustrates the geographic distribution of excess deaths, emphasizing New South Wales and Victoria. This highlights the importance of regional factors such as population density and healthcare access in driving excess mortality rates.

Socioeconomic Status and Mortality: This section uses the quintiles method to divide the population into five socio-economic groups, showing that lower-income groups were disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Financial and healthcare access barriers played a significant role in the higher mortality rates among these groups.

Health-Related Factors and Comorbidities: The report examines the role of pre-existing medical conditions in exacerbating COVID-19 mortality. It also identifies common underlying causes of death among COVID-19 patients, such as cancer, circulatory diseases, and dementia, which were impacted by the pandemic.

COVID-19 Deaths by Comorbidities: This section tracks the impact of comorbidities on excess mortality, showing that individuals with prior health issues were at a higher risk of death, especially those aged 75 and older.

Impact of Vaccination on Excess Mortality: As vaccination rates increased in 2023, excess mortality and COVID-19-related deaths decreased. Over 95% of Australians aged 16 and above were vaccinated with at least two doses, leading to a significant reduction in mortality rates.

FUTHER MODELLING SUGGESTION

● Statistical models: non-linear models or non-parametrics models (neural networks, trees) since the data seems not satisfy the linear assumption and the distribution is unclear.

● Survival Model: Cox Ph, mortality model (Lee-Carter, APC with cohort effect)
